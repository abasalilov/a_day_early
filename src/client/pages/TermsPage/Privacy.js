                    <h2>THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
                    <p>
                        Personal information is data that can be used to identify you directly or
                        indirectly, or to contact you. Our Privacy Policy covers all personal
                        information that you voluntarily submit to us and that we obtain from our
                        partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to anonymized data as it cannot
                        be used to identify you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Except as described in this Privacy Policy, A Day Early will not give,
                        sell, rent or loan any personal Information to any third party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We collect personal information to provide you with our Services. When we
                        require certain personal information from users it is because we are
                        required by applicable law to collect this information or it is relevant for
                        specified purposes. Any information you provide to us that is not required
                        is voluntary. You are free to choose whether to provide us with the types of
                        personal information requested, but we may not be able to serve you as
                        effectively or offer you all of our Services when you do choose not to share
                        certain information with us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, we collect personal information which is required under the law
                        to open an account, add a payment method, or execute a transaction. We also
                        collect personal information when you use or request information about our
                        Services, subscribe to marketing communications, request support, complete
                        surveys, or sign up for a A Day Early event. We may also collect
                        personal information from you offline, such as when you attend one of our
                        events, or when you contact customer support. We may use this information in
                        combination with other information we collect about you, as set forth in
                        this Notice.

                        We collect information about your publically available social media profile,
                        interests or preferences, and page-view information from some business
                        partners with which we operate co-branded services or joint offerings. There
                        are multiple purposes for collecting this information. First, we process
                        such information to better understand you and/or maintain and improve the
                        accuracy of the records we hold about you as well as to position, promote or
                        optimize our Services. In addition, we may also use this information in
                        conjunction with your browsing habits / preferences (as obtained from our
                        data partners) and your contact details, professional information and A Day Early
                        Development transaction history to deliver targeted advertising and
                        marketing to you, where permitted by applicable law and in accordance with
                        your advertising / marketing preferences. Second, we also process such
                        information to provide support to you as part of our contractual obligations
                        to you. Lastly, we process such information in the public interest because
                        it helps us monitor, prevent and detect fraud.

                    <p>
                        Once we obtain such information from third parties, we do not subsequently
                        share it with any other third parties except as described in this Policy.
                        This information is shared with A Day Early&#39;s processors and
                        corporate group as necessary to perform the Services.

                            public records and other third party databases. These service providers

                    <h2>HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you use your A Day Early Account to transfer Digital Currency in
                        connection with the purchase or sale of goods or services, we or you may
                        also provide the seller with your shipping address, name, and/or email to
                        help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to
                        use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed
                        to it. If an attempt to transfer Digital Currency to your seller fails or is
                        later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the
                        unsuccessful transfer. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a
                        buyer with the seller&#39;s address so that goods can be returned to the
                        seller.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In connection with a Digital Currency transfer between you and a third
                        party, including merchants, a third party may share information about you
                        with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number which may be used
                        to inform you that a transfer has been sent to or received from the third
                        party. We may use this information in connection with such transfers to
                        confirm that you are a A Day Early customer, that Digital Currency
                        transfers are enabled, and/or to notify you that you have received Digital
                        Currency. If you request that we validate your status as a A Day Early
                        customer with a third party, we will do so. You may also choose to send
                        Digital Currency to or request Digital Currency from an email address. In
                        such cases, your user name will be displayed in an email message notifying
                        the user of the designated email address of your action.

                        collected by third parties, which may include such things as contact details
                        or location data, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you
                        to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.

                    <p>
                        We understand how important your privacy is, which is why A Day Early
                        maintains (and requires its service providers to maintain) appropriate
                        physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security
                        and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional
                        information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted
                        bank account and/or routing numbers, in the United States and elsewhere in
                        the world where our facilities or our service providers are located. We
                        protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and
                        procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and
                        regulations.

                    <p>
                        For example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data
                        encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files,
                        and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who
                        require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit card data is
                        securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment vendor in compliance
                        with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This
                        information is not accessible to A Day Early&#39;s staff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or
                        alteration of your data will not occur. Please recognize that you play a
                        vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering
                        with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length
                        and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to
                        immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or
                        use of your account.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of

                        connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of
                        protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you
                        have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us

                        resolution mechanism. Our independent dispute resolution mechanism is the
                        International Centre for Dispute Resolution (&quot;ICDR&quot;), operated by
                        the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;). For more information
                        and to file a complaint, you may contact the International Centre for
                        Dispute Resolution by phone at +1.212.484.4181, or by visiting the website{' '}

                    <p>
                        We are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.
                        Federal Trade Commission with respect to the Framework. Please note that if
                        your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited
                        circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a
                        Privacy Shield Panel. In certain situations, A Day Early may be
                        required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by
                        public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement
                        requirements.

                    <h2>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        You are entitled to review, correct, or amend your personal information, or
                        to delete that information where it is inaccurate. You may do this at any
                        time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile tab. This right
                        shall only be limited where the burden or expense of providing access would
                        be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or
                        where the rights of persons other than you would be violated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you close your A Day Early account, we will mark your account in
                        our database as &quot;Closed,&quot; but will keep your account information
                        in our database for a period of time described above. This is necessary in
                        order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will
                        not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a
                        new account. However, if you close your account, your personal information
                        will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with
                        third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law
                        enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                    </p>

                        retain your personal information for a minimum of five years or as necessary
                        to comply with our legal obligations or to resolve disputes.

                        does not necessarily reveal your identity directly but may include

                        settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request
                        and referral URL), broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level
                        location) and other technical data collected through cookies, pixel tags and
                        other similar technologies that uniquely identify your browser. We may also
                        collect information about how your device has interacted with our website,
                        including pages accessed and links clicked. We may use identifiers to
                        recognize you when you arrive at the Site via an external link, such as a
                        link appearing on a third party site.

                        of being younger than 18 years of age, A Day Early will require the
                        user to close his or her account and will not allow buying or selling
                        digital currencies. We will also take steps to delete the information as

                        Services.
